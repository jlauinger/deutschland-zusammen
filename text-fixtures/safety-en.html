    Deutschlandzusammen.de is a website which brings people together. You can't know if your conversation partner is
    the one they claim to be until you meet them - just like with any other internet service.

    Keep your private address safe when offering help. You tell us your address when creating your profile, but it is
    only used for the radius-based search and never shown publicly. Exchange addresses only via private messages,
    ideally using the integrated messages on deutschlandzusammen.de.

<p>
    If you make your phone number or e-mail address public through your profile, people looking for help can find you
    a lot faster. But keep in mind that your data is published on the internet then. When in doubt, better use the
    integrated messages on deutschlandzusammen.de.

<h2>Tips for your hygiene</h2>

<p>
    Think of the following guidelines when you are helping your neighbour to keep both of you save:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do not exchange shopping lists personally, instead send them by email or phone</li>
    <li>Wear gloves when you go shopping and do not touch your face</li>
    <li>Call your neighbour instead of ringing at the door to tell them that their groceries arrived</li>
    <li>
        Do not exchange groceries personally, put it in front of the door or at a special place and keep a distance
        of two meters or more
    </li>
    <li>Do not exchange money personally, instead put it at an agreed-upon place</li>
    <li>Thoroughly wash your hands as often as possible, especially after receiving e.g. groceries</li>
</ul>
