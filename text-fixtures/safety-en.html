    Deutschlandzusammen.de is a website which brings people together. You can't know if your conversation partner is
    the one they claim to be until you meet them - just like with any other internet service.

    Keep your private address safe when offering help. You tell us your address when creating your profile, but it is
    only used for the radius-based search and never shown publicly. Exchange addresses only via private messages,
    ideally using the integrated messages on deutschlandzusammen.de.

    If you make your phone number or e-mail address public through your profile, people looking for help can find you
    a lot faster. But keep in mind that your data is published on the internet then. When in doubt, better use the
    integrated messages on deutschlandzusammen.de.
