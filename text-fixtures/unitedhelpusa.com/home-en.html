            Are you able and willing to help your neighbor with e.g. grocery shopping, walking their pet, getting
            medicine for them, or any other thing you might think of? Great!

        <ol class="how-it-works">
            <li>
                You create a profile and tell us where you live and when and what kind of help you can offer. You also
                give us a radius around your location wherein you can reach people looking for help. Don't worry, your
                address will never be shown publicly.

            <li>
                When somebody finds your profile, they can send you a message directly through unitedhelpusa.com.
                You receive it by e-mail and into your profile. We can also send you a push notification directly to
                your phone.<br /><br />
                You can even put your phone number into your profile so people can reach you even faster, but remember
                that it is public then. We have put together some important advice about how to secure your privacy and
